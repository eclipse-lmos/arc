# Services

### Naming Conventions

*   **Avoid "Service" Suffix**: Class names should reflect what they *do* or *are*, rather than being generic "Services".
    *   *Bad*: `TestService`, `EvaluationService`
    *   *Good*: `TestExecutor`, `ConversationEvaluator`, `McpManager`
*   **Descriptive Identifiers**: Use clear and descriptive names for all classes and methods.
